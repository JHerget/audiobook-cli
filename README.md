# Audiobook Command Line Interface
The purpose of this script is to simplyfy the process of downloading audiobooks from a server, extracting them, and prepping them to be loaded onto my phone.

Although it could be faster to use the web interface for exploring new books and authors, this script offers lots of opportunity in the future!

## TODO
* Make the navigation clearer.
* Allow users to download all books for an author at the same time.
* Add an option to see the list of recently added books.
* Automatically download books from a "to read" list.
    * Pull the list from a file or Goodreads.
    * Periodically check the catalog for books that were previously not found.
    * Add text or email notifications for when new books from your list are found.
* Allow users to search for authors, books, keywords, and tags explicitly.
* Allow users to modify sort and filter parameters for books and authors.
